LeetForceForge
Welcome to LeetForceForge, the ultimate hub for my competitive programming journey! This repository is where I sharpen my algorithmic sword, tackling challenges from LeetCode and Codeforces to forge my skills into legendary status. 💻⚡
About
This repo is a collection of my solutions, notes, and insights from grinding problems on:

LeetCode: Mastering data structures and algorithms with real-world problem-solving.
Codeforces: Battling it out in contests to boost my competitive edge.

Each solution is crafted with care, optimized for clarity, and often accompanied by explanations to solidify my understanding (and maybe help you too!).
Structure

/LeetCode: Solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by problem ID or topic (e.g., arrays, dynamic programming).
/Codeforces: Solutions to Codeforces contests and problems, grouped by contest or problem type.
/Notes: Key concepts, tricks, and lessons learned from my coding grind.
/Utils: Handy templates, snippets, or helper functions for competitive programming.

Goals

🥋 Master core algorithms and data structures.
🏆 Climb the ranks in Codeforces contests.
🌟 Achieve a high LeetCode rating and solve 500+ problems.
📝 Document my journey to reinforce learning and inspire others.

Tech Stack

Languages: Primarily C++, with some Python for prototyping or specific problems.
Tools: VS Code, Git, and a lot of coffee ☕.
